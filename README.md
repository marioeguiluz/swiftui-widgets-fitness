## Welcome! <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3911039/113623796-c025f900-9656-11eb-929e-17d3c22357ff.gif" width="30px" alt="wave gif">



### What is this project?
This project will try to help you understand the basics behind SwiftUI and Combine (+ some Widgets and HealthKit!).
It contains different branches that will incrementally add functionality, from the most basic state, to the addition of widgets and more configuration.



### Why did I started this project?
I love Apple Fitness workout views but sadly (as today), those same views are not offered as widgets for the home screen. So I am replicating those ones, and adding the widget-capability myself. By open sourcing it, I thought It could be a great example for other developers to see how to deploy a basic structure of SwiftUI-Combine + Widgets and HealthKit with clear and concise code.
Feel free to open PR or issues to improve it!
